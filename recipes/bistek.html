<ol>
    <li>Combine soy sauce, lime juice, garlic, sugar, fish sauce, and pepper in a bowl.

        Marinate for at least 30 minutes or up to 1 hour. </li>
    <li>Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a wok or pan over medium-high heat. 
        Fry potatoes in the hot oil until the edges turn golden brown, 7 to 10 minutes. 
        Transfer to a plate.</li>
    <li>Heat remaining oil in the same pan over medium-high heat and fry onions until edges turn brown, 7 to 10 minutes. 
        Transfer to the same plate.</li>
    <li>Heat the same pan over medium-high heat. 
        Reserve marinade and fry beef in batches, adding more vegetable oil if necessary, until browned and no longer pink in the centers, 5 to 7 minutes. 
        Transfer to the plate and continue with remaining beef.</li>
    <li>Pour reserved marinade into the pan with water to deglaze, scraping up browned bits from the bottom of the pan using a wooden spoon. 
        taste and adjust seasonings. Return beef back to the pan with some onion, 
        leaving remaining onion for garnish; reduce heat and let simmer until sauce has thickened, 7 to 10 minutes.</li>
