    <h3>What is Pan De Sal?</h3>
The dough for this rolls are made using a bread maker. 
    No more kneading! These rolls taste fantastic, best I've ever had. 
    Bread improver is easy to find in some countries, but if it is not available, you may leave it out.



    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 1/2 teaspoons active dry yeast</li>
        <li>3 1/4 cups bread flour</li>
        <li>3/4 teaspoon bread improver</li>
        <li>1/4 cup sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons margarine</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup canned evaporated milk</li>
        <li>1/2 cup dry bread crumbs</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Place the yeast, bread flour, bread improver, sugar, salt, margarine, eggs, and 1 cup of evaporated milk into a bread machine in the order recommended by the manufacturer. Select the Dough cycle, and press start.
        </li>
        <li>
            When the cycle has ended, remove the dough from the machine, and form into 2 inch balls. Dip each ball in the remaining evaporated milk, then in the dry bread crumbs. Place the rolls on a baking sheet crumb-side up. Cover loosely with a cloth or plastic, and let rise until doubled in size, about 30 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bake rolls for 8 minutes, or until golden brown on the top and bottom.
        </li>
    </ol>
